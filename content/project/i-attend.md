i-attend is an android application that takes attendance based on location. Aim of this application is to automate the attendance tracking process. The motivation behind this is the laborious work that is conducted before the start of each class meeting. This application allows attendees to mark their own attendance.

### Design and Implementation
* Secure and easy sign up using google account.
* Verifies attendance based on location.
* Endpoints API that can support multiple front ends.
